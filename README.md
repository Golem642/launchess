Playable chess game on Novation Launchpad

This is a chess game i made on a Launchpad using Python. It supports undo/redo, assisted movements, pieces details, automatic turns, etc...
By default, the settings are set to work with a Launchpad Mini MK3 but you can change to whatever you want as soon as you know the in and out port names (replace "MIDIIN2" and "MIDIOUT2" by them)

To access the game, you must enter Legacy mode on your Novation Launchpad and then start the project. If you are lost, take a look at the Python console.

Have fun !
