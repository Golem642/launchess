Playable chess game on Novation Launchpad

This is a chess game i made on a Launchpad using Python. It supports undo/redo, assisted movements, pieces details, automatic turns, etc...
By default, the settings are set to work with a Launchpad Mini MK3 but you can change to whatever you want as soon as you know the in and out port names (replace "MIDIIN2" and "MIDIOUT2" by them)

To access the game, you must enter Legacy mode on your Novation Launchpad and then start the project. If you are lost, take a look at the Python console.

Have fun !

P.S: the right column indicates you wich player turn it is depending on the color and you can press them to see your pieces and the other player pieces. The order is (from to to bottom): King, Queen, Fool, Horse, Tower and the normal pieces. (you can also press a piece to see wich one is it or look at the console)

P.P.S: to enter undo/redo mode, both players have to press the non-lighted key under the info bar on the side, they will became orange and you will be able to go back using arrow keys and validate using up key. (you must have atleast played one move)
